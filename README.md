🌼 Flower Classification CNN Model 🌻

🌟 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based flower classification application built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It can identify images of flowers belonging to the following categories:

🌼 Daisy
🌻 Dandelion
🌹 Rose
🌞 Sunflower
🌷 Tulip
The application utilizes TensorFlow and Keras, and is deployed with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive web interface for users to upload an image and receive instant predictions.

✨ Features
📁 Image Upload: Upload a flower image directly through the web interface.
🌼 Image Classification: The model processes the image and predicts the flower category, displaying the result along with the confidence score.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple and accessible for anyone interested in flower classification.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Streamlit
Numpy
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-classification-cnn-model.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copier le code
cd flower-classification-cnn-model
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

bash
Copier le code
streamlit run app.py
Open the web application in your browser. You will see an interface where you can upload a flower image.

Upload the image, and the model will predict the flower type and display the classification result along with the confidence score.

🧠 Model Architecture
The CNN model has the following structure:

Data Augmentation: Includes random flipping, rotation, and zoom to increase dataset variety.
Conv2D & MaxPooling Layers: Convolutional and pooling layers to extract and downsample features.
Dropout Layer: To reduce overfitting during training.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for classification.
The model is trained on a popular Flowers dataset, which contains multiple images for each flower category, ensuring robust and accurate classification.
